	"Answers": ["My name is Chen An Li. I am a junior in the department of computer science at National Taiwan University. I have attended some projects with classmates and friends, such as CSIE camp Challenge and the NeurIPS HEAR challenge. I collaborate with others well in these experiences. After studying some concepts about computer science, I found that I am interested in Natural Language Processing, especially speech. I worked as a teaching assistant in two Machine learning classes, and I learned how to teach others and communicate with others well. I am also a research student of two labs, one is related to data analysis and another is about speech. After attending Line Developers Meetup #16 and listening to those team introductions, I am interested in the Data Dev team, which meets the research topic I am working on. I think Line is full of vitality, and I hope I can participate in the 2022 TECH FRESH - Summer Class."]
